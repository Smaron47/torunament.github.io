## 🧠 Architecture & Data Flow

### Input & Preprocessing

* User enters names and total number of participants.
* Validates count vs input list.
* Sanitizes entries.
* Randomizes player order with Fisher-Yates shuffle.
* Calculates byes to match nearest power-of-two.

### Bracket Logic

* Dynamically builds bracket tree.
* Ensures no two byes are placed consecutively.
* Enables click-to-advance mechanics.
* Tracks history for undo functionality.

### Exporting

* Utilizes `html2canvas` to export the bracket to an image.

## 📁 File Structure Breakdown

### `index.html`

* Responsive HTML structure with form inputs and bracket container.
* Loads main stylesheet and scripts.

### `style.css`

* Flex-based layout with high contrast design.
* Styled interactive buttons with hover and selected states.
* Responsive design considerations.
* Accessible fonts, spacing, and contrast.

### `script.js`

* Core logic: input parsing, round generation, and interactivity.
* Major Functions:

  * `shuffleArray()` - Fisher-Yates algorithm.
  * `generateBracket()` - Master function to build bracket.
  * `createNextRound()` - Recursively constructs rounds.
  * `selectWinner()` - Handles winner progression.
  * `undoLastAction()` - Reverts to previous bracket state.
  * `takeScreenshot()` - Prepares and exports bracket as image.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging
